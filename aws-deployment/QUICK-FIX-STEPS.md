# Quick Fix Steps for CryptoEscrow Backend

## Current Issues Identified:
1. ❌ PM2 cannot load `.mjs` ESM config files
2. ✅ Firebase service account is properly stored in AWS Secrets Manager
3. ❌ Backend needs proper ESM configuration

## **IMMEDIATE FIX - Run on your EC2 instance:**

### Step 1: SSH to your EC2 instance
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@44.202.141.56
cd /home/ec2-user/cryptoescrow-backend
```

### Step 2: Remove conflicting files and pull updates
```bash
# Remove problematic files
rm -f create-firebase-json-improved.sh create-firebase-json.sh
rm -f ecosystem.config.mjs

# Pull the latest fixes
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Run the final fix script
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x aws-deployment/final-backend-fix.sh

# Run the comprehensive fix
./aws-deployment/final-backend-fix.sh
```

## **What the Fix Script Does:**

1. ✅ **Removes problematic `.mjs` config** - PM2 doesn't support ESM configs
2. ✅ **Uses correct CommonJS ecosystem config** - But configured for ESM applications  
3. ✅ **Verifies Firebase service account** - Confirms it's properly stored in AWS Secrets Manager
4. ✅ **Fixes polyfills for Node.js 18** - Uses native fetch, adds fallbacks
5. ✅ **Tests startup** - Ensures Firebase loads from AWS Secrets Manager
6. ✅ **Starts with PM2** - Using the correct configuration

## **Expected Output:**
```
✅ Firebase service account found in AWS Secrets Manager
✅ Firebase service account is properly configured (Project: ethescrow-377c6)
✅ Firebase Admin SDK successfully loaded from AWS Secrets Manager
🎉 SUCCESS! Backend is running and healthy!
```

## **If You Still Have Issues:**

### Check Firebase Service Account Loading:
```bash
# View startup logs
pm2 logs cryptoescrow-backend --lines 50

# Look for these success messages:
# "Firebase Admin SDK initialized with service account from AWS Secrets Manager"
# "Using Production configuration for Admin SDK with AWS Secrets Manager"
```

### Manual Health Check:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Check Environment Variables:
```bash
cat .env | grep -E "(FIREBASE|AWS|USE_AWS)"
```

## **Your Firebase Service Account is Already Perfect! ✅**

From the screenshot you shared, I can see your Firebase service account in AWS Secrets Manager contains:
- ✅ `project_id`: `ethescrow-377c6`
- ✅ `private_key`: Present and properly formatted
- ✅ `client_email`: `firebase-adminsdk-...@ethescrow-377c6.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- ✅ All required fields are present

The issue was **not** with the Firebase service account - it was with PM2's ESM configuration!

## **Summary:**
- Your Firebase credentials are correctly stored ✅
- The backend just needed proper PM2/ESM configuration ✅  
- This fix addresses the PM2 compatibility issue ✅

**Run the script and your backend should work perfectly!** 🚀
